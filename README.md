DATA SOURCE(S)

FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains a personal fitness tracker from thirty-three FitBit users. Thirty-three eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
The FitBit Dataset was limited in the sense that it did not contain significant information about the participants such as gender, age, occupation, location, etc. Also,

The data is not representative of all FitBit users as only 33 participants took part in the survey
The data is from a third-party source and there are no ways of examining credibility as well as testing for bias
The data was collected 6 years ago (2016) and does not account for significant changes in technology and features available in recent times.
DOCUMENTATION

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle into Microsoft Excel for an overview, and the following was noticed:

Twelve participants did not wear the FitBit device for the complete month of the survey
Only eight participants submitted weight info
There was no personal information about the participants
Based on the overview, five tables were selected for the analysis; dailyActivity, hourlyCalories, hourlyIntensities, hourlySteps, sleepDay

The tables were converted into excel files and exported to Microsoft SQL Server for data cleaning.
